  ## Description
  With the help of MongoDB, Expres.js, Mongoose, & Insomnia, I was able to create a mock Social Networking API that will allow a user to visualize a structured database.  Because this code is mainly used to test a backend API, Insomnia will be a crucial part to this project.  A user can test different routes within Insomnia.  A user can create/delete/update/and get data information in regards to a username/email, thoughts, reactions, and even have the capability to add other usernames/emails to their friends list.  This project is mainly used to beter understand and visualize the CRUD operations in backend development.
